Tabulated spectrum locus coordinates for CIE 1931 2-degree downloaded from:

Under Chromaticity Coordinates, CIE 1931 2-deg xyz chromaticity coordinates
using the second button "/W" with a solid (instead of dashed) line indicating
higher sampling resolution (1 nm)
(Note that chromaticity values do not change beyond 699 nm, likely due to the
fact that rounding errors seem to cause the spectrum locus to start wandering
about back on itself based on chromaticities converted from the tabulated color
matching functions - the converted values were abandoned and 699 nm copied down
for the remainder of the series.)
